          # ðŸ¤– Preview Environment
          The preview environment is running.
          
          # Accessing the static preview UI
          This version of the UI is static but updated regularly. The updates will lag quite a lot, as IPFS needs
          some time to propagate changes. You'd also need to refresh the page to get an update. This version of the UI
          is not able to interact with the cluster, due to missing WebSockets support in IPFS. Use IPFS p2p forwarding
          if you need this.
          
          The public gateway url is: https://ipfs.io/ipns/$(cat static_ipns_name)/index.html
          
          For much better perforamance and update-speed, install and start [IPFS Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/)
          locally and use this URL: http://$(cat static_ipns_name).ipns.localhost:8080/index.html
          
          If you configured a different gateway port then the default (8080), fix the url accordingly.
          
          # Accessing the dynamic preview UI
          First, install and start [IPFS Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/) locally.
          Then run the \`http\` forward command from below.
          After that, the UI will be accessible through http://localhost:9090.
          
          IPFS forward commands:
          http: \`ipfs p2p forward /x/kluctl-webui /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9090 /p2p/$(cat ipfs_id)\`
          ssh: \`ipfs p2p forward /x/ssh /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2222 /p2p/$(cat ipfs_id)\`
          k8s: \`ipfs p2p forward /x/k /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/6443 /p2p/$(cat ipfs_id)\`
          
          When asked for credentials, use admin:admin.
          
          # Shutting it down
          Either cancel the pipeline in the PR or simply wait for 30 minutes until it auto-terminates.
