# KluctlDeployment

The `KluctlDeployment` API defines a deployment of a [target](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/targets)
from a [Kluctl Project](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project).

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: microservices-demo-prod
spec:
  interval: 5m
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples.git
      path: "./microservices-demo/3-templating-and-multi-env/"
  timeout: 2m
  target: prod
  context: default
  prune: true
  delete: true
  manual: true
```

In the above example a KluctlDeployment is being created that defines the deployment based on the Kluctl project.

The deployment is performed every 5 minutes. It will deploy the `prod`
[target](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/targets) and then prune orphaned objects afterward.

When the KluctlDeployment gets deleted, `delete: true` will cause the controller to actually delete the target
resources.

It uses the `default` context provided by the default service account and thus overrides the context specified in the
target definition.

## Spec fields

### source

The KluctlDeployment `spec.source` specifies the source repository to be used. Example:

Multiple source types are supported, as described in the following subsections.

#### Git source

Specifies a Git repository to load the project source from.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples.git
      path: path/to/project
      ref:
        branch: my-branch
  credentials:
    git:
      - host: github.com
        path: kluctl/*
        secretRef:
          name: git-credentials
  ...
```

The `url` specifies the git clone url. It can either be a https or a git/ssh url. Git/Ssh url will require a secret
to be provided with credentials.

The `path` specifies the subdirectory where the Kluctl project is located.

The `ref` provides the Git reference to be used. The `ref` field has the same format as in
[git includes](../../../kluctl/deployments/deployment-yml.md#git-includes).

See [Git authentication](#git-authentication) for details on authentication via the `spec.credentials.git` field.

#### OCI source

Specifies a OCI artifact to load the project source from. The artifact must have been pushed via the
[kluctl oci push](../../../kluctl/commands/oci-push.md) command.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  source:
    oci:
      url: oci://ghcr.io/kluctl/kluctl-examples/simple
      path: my-subdir
      ref:
        tag: latest
  credentials:
    oci:
      - registry: ghcr.io
        repository: kluctl/**
        secretRef:
          name: oci-credentials
  ...
```

The `url` specifies the OCI repository url. It must use the `oci://` scheme. It is not allowed to add tags or digests to
the url. Instead, use the dedicated `ref` field.

The `path` specifies the subdirectory where the Kluctl project is located.

The `ref` provides the Git reference to be used. The `ref` field has the same format as in
[oci includes](../../../kluctl/deployments/deployment-yml.md#oci-includes).

See [OCI authentication](#oci-registry-authentication) for details on authentication via the `spec.credentials.oci` field.

### interval
See [Reconciliation](#reconciliation).

### deployInterval
If set, the controller will periodically force a deployment, even if the rendered manifests have not changed. 
See [Reconciliation](#reconciliation) for more details.

### suspend
See [Reconciliation](#reconciliation).

### target
`spec.target` specifies the target to be deployed. It must exist in the Kluctl projects
[kluctl.yaml targets](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/targets) list.

This field is optional and can be omitted if the referenced Kluctl project allows deployments without targets.

### targetNameOverride
`spec.targetNameOverride` will set or override the name of the target. This is equivalent to passing
`--target-name-override` to `kluctl deploy`.

### context
`spec.context` will override the context used while deploying. This is equivalent to passing `--context` to
`kluctl deploy`.

### deployMode
By default, the operator will perform a full deployment, which is equivalent to using the `kluctl deploy` command.
As an alternative, the controller can be instructed to only perform a `kluctl poke-images` command. Please
see [poke-images](../../../kluctl/commands/poke-images.md) for details on the command. To do so, set `spec.deployMode`
field to `poke-images`.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: microservices-demo-prod
spec:
  interval: 5m
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples.git
      path: "./microservices-demo/3-templating-and-multi-env/"
  timeout: 2m
  target: prod
  context: default
  deployMode: poke-images
```

### prune

To enable pruning, set `spec.prune` to `true`. This will cause the controller to run `kluctl prune` after each
successful deployment.

### delete

To enable deletion, set `spec.delete` to `true`. This will cause the controller to run `kluctl delete` when the
KluctlDeployment gets deleted.

### manual

`spec.manual` enables manually approved/triggered deployments. This means, that deployments are performed in dry-run
mode until the most recent deployment is approved. 

This feature is most useful in combination with the Kluctl Webui, which offers a visualisation and proper actions
for this feature.

Internally, approval happens by setting `spec.manualObjectsHash` to the objects hash of the approved command result.

### args
`spec.args` is an object representing [arguments](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/README.md#args)
passed to the deployment. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  interval: 5m
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples.git
      path: "./microservices-demo/3-templating-and-multi-env/"
  timeout: 2m
  target: prod
  context: default
  args:
    arg1: value1
    arg2: value2
    arg3:
      k1: v1
      k2: v2
```

The above example is equivalent to calling `kluctl deploy -t prod -a arg1=value1 -a arg2=value2`.

### images
`spec.images` specifies a list of fixed images to be used by
[`image.get_image(...)`](../../../kluctl/deployments/images.md#imagesget_image). Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  interval: 5m
  source:
    git:
      url: https://example.com
  timeout: 2m
  target: prod
  images:
    - image: nginx
      resultImage: nginx:1.21.6
      namespace: example-namespace
      deployment: Deployment/example
    - image: registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image
      resultImage: registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image:1.2.3
```

The above example will cause the `images.get_image("nginx")` invocations of the `example` Deployment to return
`nginx:1.21.6`. It will also cause all `images.get_image("registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image")` invocations
to return `registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image:1.2.3`.

The fixed images provided here take precedence over the ones provided in the
[target definition](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/targets#images).

`spec.images` is equivalent to calling `kluctl deploy -t prod --fixed-image=nginx:example-namespace:Deployment/example=nginx:1.21.6 ...`
and to `kluctl deploy -t prod --fixed-images-file=fixed-images.yaml` with `fixed-images.yaml` containing:

```yaml
images:
- image: nginx
  resultImage: nginx:1.21.6
  namespace: example-namespace
  deployment: Deployment/example
- image: registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image
  resultImage: registry.gitlab.com/my-org/my-repo/image:1.2.3
```

### dryRun
`spec.dryRun` is a boolean value that turns the deployment into a dry-run deployment. This is equivalent to calling
`kluctl deploy -t prod --dry-run`.

### noWait
`spec.noWait` is a boolean value that disables all internal waiting (hooks and readiness). This is equivalent to calling
`kluctl deploy -t prod --no-wait`.

### forceApply
`spec.forceApply` is a boolean value that causes kluctl to solve conflicts via force apply. This is equivalent to calling
`kluctl deploy -t prod --force-apply`.

### replaceOnError and forceReplaceOnError
`spec.replaceOnError` and `spec.forceReplaceOnError` are both boolean values that cause kluctl to perform a replace
after a failed apply. `forceReplaceOnError` goes a step further and deletes and recreates the object in question.
These are equivalent to calling `kluctl deploy -t prod --replace-on-error` and `kluctl deploy -t prod --force-replace-on-error`.

### abortOnError
`spec.abortOnError` is a boolean value that causes kluctl to abort as fast as possible in case of errors. This is equivalent to calling
`kluctl deploy -t prod --abort-on-error`.

### includeTags, excludeTags, includeDeploymentDirs and excludeDeploymentDirs
`spec.includeTags` and `spec.excludeTags` are lists of tags to be used in inclusion/exclusion logic while deploying.
These are equivalent to calling `kluctl deploy -t prod --include-tag <tag1>` and `kluctl deploy -t prod --exclude-tag <tag2>`.

`spec.includeDeploymentDirs` and `spec.excludeDeploymentDirs` are lists of relative deployment directories to be used in
inclusion/exclusion logic while deploying. These are equivalent to calling `kluctl deploy -t prod --include-tag <tag1>`
and `kluctl deploy -t prod --exclude-tag <tag2>`.

## Reconciliation

The KluctlDeployment `spec.interval` tells the controller at which interval to try reconciliations.
The interval time units are `s`, `m` and `h` e.g. `interval: 5m`, the minimum value should be over 60 seconds.

At each reconciliation run, the controller will check if any rendered objects have been changes since the last
deployment and then perform a new deployment if changes are detected. Changes are tracked via a hash consisting of
all rendered objects.

To enforce periodic full deployments even if nothing has changed, `spec.deployInterval` can be used to specify an
interval at which forced deployments must be performed by the controller.

The KluctlDeployment reconciliation can be suspended by setting `spec.suspend` to `true`. Suspension will however not
prevent manual reconciliation requests via the `kluctl gitops` sub-commands.

## Manual requests/reconciliation

The controller can be told to reconcile the KluctlDeployment outside of the specified interval
by using the [`kluctl gitops`](../../../kluctl/commands/README.md) sub-commands.

On-demand reconciliation example:

```bash
kluctl gitops deploy --namespace my-namespace --name my-deployment
```

You can also perform manual requests while temporarily overriding deployment configurations, e.g.:

```bash
kluctl gitops deploy --namespace my-namespace --name my-deployment --force-apply
```

Local source overrides are also possible, allowing you to test changes before pushing them:

```bash
kluctl gitops diff --namespace my-namespace --name my-deployment --local-git-override=github.com/exaple-org/example-project=/local/path/to/modified/repo
```

When `--namespace` and `--name` are omitted, the CLI will try to auto-detect the deployment on the current cluster
and suggest the auto-detected deployment to you.

## Kubeconfigs and RBAC

As Kluctl is meant to be a CLI-first tool, it expects a kubeconfig to be present while deployments are
performed. The controller will generate such kubeconfigs on-the-fly before performing the actual deployment.

The kubeconfig can be generated from 3 different sources:
1. The default impersonation service account specified at controller startup (via `--default-service-account`)
2. The service account specified via `spec.serviceAccountName` in the KluctlDeployment
3. The secret specified via `spec.kubeConfig` in the KluctlDeployment.

The behavior/functionality of 1. and 2. is comparable to how the [kustomize-controller](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/kustomize/kustomization/#role-based-access-control)
handles impersonation, with the difference that a kubeconfig with a "default" context is created in-between.

`spec.kubeConfig` will simply load the kubeconfig from `data.value` of the specified secret.

Kluctl [targets](../../../kluctl/kluctl-project/targets) specify a context name that is expected to
be present in the kubeconfig while deploying. As the context found in the generated kubeconfig does not necessarily
have the correct name, `spec.context` can be used to while deploying. This is especially useful
when using service account based kubeconfigs, as these always have the same context with the name "default".

Here is an example of a deployment that uses the service account "prod-service-account" and overrides the context
appropriately (assuming the Kluctl cluster config for the given target expects a "prod" context):

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: kluctl-system
spec:
  interval: 10m
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples.git
      path: "./microservices-demo/3-templating-and-multi-env/"
  target: prod
  serviceAccountName: prod-service-account
  context: default
```

## Credentials
A `KluctlDeployment` can specify multiple sets of credentials for different kind of repositories and registries. These
are specified through the `spec.credentials` field, which specifies multiple list of credentials.

### Git authentication
Git authentication can be specified via `spec.credentials.git`, which is a list of credential configs. Each entry
specifies information to match Git repositories and a reference to a Kubernetes secret.

Each time the controller needs to access a git repository, it will iterate through this list and pick the first one
matching.

Example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git
  credentials:
    git:
      - host: github.com
        path: my-org/*
        secretRef:
          name: my-git-secrets
...
```

Each entry has the following fields:

`host` is required and specifies the hostname to apply this set of credentials. It can also be set to `*`, meaning that
it will match all git hosts. `*` will however be ignored for https based urls to avoid leaking credentials.

`path` is optional and allows to filter for different paths on the same host. This is for example useful
when public Git providers are used, for example github.com. For these, you can for example use `my-org/*` as pattern to
tell the controller that it should use this set of credentials only for projects below the `my-org` GitHub organisation.

`secretRef` is required and specifies the name of the secret that contains the actual credentials.

The following authentication types are supported through the referenced secret.

#### Basic access authentication

To authenticate towards a Git repository over HTTPS using basic access
authentication (in other words: using a username and password), the referenced
Secret is expected to contain `.data.username` and `.data.password` values.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: basic-access-auth
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <BASE64>
  password: <BASE64>
```

#### HTTPS Certificate Authority

To provide a Certificate Authority to trust while connecting with a Git
repository over HTTPS, the referenced Secret can contain a `.data.caFile`
value.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: https-ca-credentials
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  caFile: <BASE64>
```

#### SSH authentication

To authenticate towards a Git repository over SSH, the referenced Secret is
expected to contain `identity` and `known_hosts` fields. With the respective
private key of the SSH key pair, and the host keys of the Git repository.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ssh-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  identity: |
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  known_hosts: |
    github.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAA...
```

### Helm Repository authentication
Kluctl allows to [integrate Helm Charts](../../../kluctl/deployments/helm.md) in two different ways.
One is to [pre-pull charts](../../../kluctl/commands/helm-pull.md) and put them into version control,
making it unnecessary to pull them at deploy time. This option also means that you don't have to take any special care
on the controller side.

The other way is to let Kluctl pull Helm Charts at deploy time. In that case, you have to ensure that the controller
has the necessary access to the Helm repositories.

Helm Repository authentication can be specified via `spec.credentials.helm`, which is a list of credential configs. Each entry
specifies information to match Helm repositories and a reference to a Kubernetes secret.

Each time the controller needs to access a Helm repository, it will iterate through this list and pick the first one
matching.

Example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git
  credentials:
    helm:
      - host: my-repo.com
        path: some-path/*
        secretRef:
          name: my-helm-secrets
...
```

Each entry has the following fields:

`host` is required and specifies the hostname to apply this set of credentials.

`path` is optional and allows to filter for different paths on the same host. The behavior is identical to how
Git credentials handle it.

`secretRef` is required and specifies the name of the secret that contains the actual credentials.

The following authentication types are supported through the referenced secret.

#### Basic access authentication

To authenticate towards a Helm repository over HTTP/HTTPS using basic access
authentication (in other words: using a username and password), the referenced
Secret is expected to contain `.data.username` and `.data.password` values.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-helm-creds
  namespace: kluctl-system
stringData:
  username: my-user
  password: my-password
```

#### TLS authentication

For TLS authentication, see the following example secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-helm-creds
  namespace: kluctl-system
data:
  certFile: <BASE64>
  keyFile: <BASE64>
  # NOTE: The following values can be supplied without the above values and for all other (e.g. basic) authentication types as well
  caFile: <BASE64>
  insecureSkipTlsVerify: "true" # this field is optional
  passCredentialsAll: "true" # this field is optional
```

`certFile` and `keyFile` optionally specify a client certificate and key pair to use for client certificate based
authentication. `caFile` specifies a CA bundle to use when TSL/https verification is performed.

If `insecureSkipTlsVerify` is set to `true`, TLS verification is skipped.

If `passCredentialsAll` is set to `true`, Kluctl will pass credentials to all domains. See https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo_add/ for details. 

### OCI registry authentication
OCI registry authentication can be specified via `spec.credentials.oci`, which is a list of credential configs. Each entry
specifies information to match OCI registries and a reference to a Kubernetes secret.

Each time the controller needs to access an OCI registry, it will iterate through this list and pick the first one
matching. This also includes OCI registry usages via the [Helm integration](../../../kluctl/deployments/helm.md).

Example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git
  credentials:
    oci:
      - registry: docker.com
        repository: my-org/*
        secretRef:
          name: my-oci-secrets
...
```

Each entry has the following fields:

`registry` is required and specifies the registry name to apply this set of credentials.

`repository` is optional and allows to filter for different repositories in the same registry. Wildcards can also be used.
If omitted, all repositories on the specified registry will match.

`secretRef` is required and specifies the name of the secret that contains the actual credentials.

The following authentication types are supported through the referenced secret.

#### Basic access authentication
To authenticate towards an OCI registry over HTTP/HTTPS using basic access
authentication (in other words: using a username and password), the referenced
Secret is expected to contain `.data.username` and `.data.password` values.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-oci-secrets
  namespace: kluctl-system
stringData:
  username: my-user
  password: my-password
```

#### Token based authentication
To authenticate via a bearer token, use specify `.data.token` in the referenced secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-oci-secrets
  namespace: kluctl-system
stringData:
  token: my-token
```

#### TLS authentication

For TLS authentication, see the following example secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-oci-creds
  namespace: kluctl-system
data:
  certFile: <BASE64>
  keyFile: <BASE64>
  # NOTE: The following values can be supplied without the above values and for all other (e.g. basic) authentication types as well
  caFile: <BASE64>
  insecureSkipTlsVerify: "true" # this field is optional
  plainHttp: "true" # this field is optional
```

`certFile` and `keyFile` optionally specify a client certificate and key pair to use for client certificate based
authentication. `caFile` specifies a CA bundle to use when TSL/https verification is performed.

If `insecureSkipTlsVerify` is set to `true`, TLS verification is skipped.

If `plainHttp` if set to `true`, HTTPS is disabled and HTTP is used instead.

### Deprecated ways of credentials configurations
Kluctl still supports the deprecated `spec.source.credentials`, `spec.source.secretRef` and `spec.helmCredentials` fields
in the `v1beta1` api version. These fields are however deprecated and will be removed in the next version bump.

## Secrets Decryption

Kluctl offers a [SOPS Integration](../../../kluctl/deployments/sops.md) that allows to use encrypted
manifests and variable sources in Kluctl deployments. Decryption by the controller is also supported and currently
mirrors how the [Secrets Decryption configuration](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#secrets-decryption)
of the Flux Kustomize Controller. To configure it in the `KluctlDeployment`, simply set the `decryption` field in the
spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: kluctl-system
spec:
  decryption:
    provider: sops
    secretRef:
      name: sops-keys
  ...
```

The `sops-keys` Secret has the same format as in the
[Flux Kustomize Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#decryption-secret-reference).

### AWS KMS with IRSA

In addition to the [AWS KMS Secret Entry](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#aws-kms-secret-entry)
in the secret and the [global AWS KMS](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#aws-kms)
authentication via the controller's service account, the Kluctl controller also supports using the IRSA role of the
impersonated service account of the `KluctlDeployment` (specified via `serviceAccountName` in the spec or
`--default-service-account`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kluctl-deployment
  namespace: kluctl-system
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456:role/my-irsa-enabled-role
---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kluctl-deployment
  namespace: kluctl-system
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  # watch out, don't use cluster-admin if you don't trust the deployment
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: kluctl-deployment
    namespace: kluctl-system
---
apiVersion: gitops.kluctl.io/v1beta1
kind: KluctlDeployment
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: kluctl-system
spec:
  serviceAccountName: kluctl-deployment
  decryption:
    provider: sops
    # you can also leave out the secretRef if you don't provide addinional keys
    secretRef:
      name: sops-keys
  ...
```

## Status

When the controller completes a deployments, it reports the result in the `status` sub-resource.

A successful reconciliation sets the ready condition to `true`.

```yaml
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-07T11:48:14Z"
    message: "deploy: ok"
    reason: ReconciliationSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  lastDeployResult:
    ...
  lastPruneResult:
    ...
  lastValidateResult:
    ...
```

You can wait for the controller to complete a reconciliation with:

```bash
kubectl wait kluctldeployment/backend --for=condition=ready
```

A failed reconciliation sets the ready condition to `false`:

```yaml
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-05-04T10:18:11Z"
    message: target invalid-name not found in kluctl project
    reason: PrepareFailed
    status: "False"
    type: Ready
  lastDeployResult:
    ...
  lastPruneResult:
    ...
  lastValidateResult:
    ...
```

> **Note** that the lastDeployResult, lastPruneResult and lastValidateResult are only updated on a successful reconciliation.
