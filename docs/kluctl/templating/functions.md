# Functions

In addition to the provided
[builtin global functions](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#list-of-global-functions),
kluctl also provides a few global functions:

### load_template(file)
Loads the given file into memory, renders it with the current Jinja2 context and then returns it as a string. Example:
```
{% set a=load_template('file.yaml') %}
{{ a }}
```

`load_template` uses the same path searching rules as described in [includes/imports](../templating#includes-and-imports).

### load_sha256(file, digest_len)
Loads the given file into memory, renders it and calculates the sha256 hash of the result.

The filename given to `load_sha256` is treated the same as in `load_template`. Recursive loading/calculating of hashes
is allowed and is solved by replacing `load_sha256` invocations with currently loaded templates with dummy strings.
This also allows to calculate the hash of the currently rendered template, for example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config-{{ load_sha256("configmap.yaml") }}
data:
```

`digest_len` is an optional parameter that allows to limit the length of the returned hex digest.

### get_var(field_path, default)
Convenience method to navigate through the current context variables via a
[JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). Let's assume you currently have these variables defined
(e.g. via [vars](../deployments/deployment-yml.md#vars-deployment-project)):
```yaml
my:
  deep:
    var: value
```
Then `{{ get_var('my.deep.var', 'my-default') }}` would return `value`.
When any of the elements inside the field path are non-existent, the given default value is returned instead.

The `field_path` parameter can also be a list of pathes, which are then tried one after the another, returning the first
result that gives a value that is not None. For example, `{{ get_var(['non.existing.var', my.deep.var'], 'my-default') }}`
would also return `value`.

### merge_dict(d1, d2)
Clones d1 and then recursively merges d2 into it and returns the result. Values inside d2 will override values in d1.

### update_dict(d1, d2)
Same as `merge_dict`, but merging is performed in-place into d1.

### raise(msg)
Raises a python exception with the given message. This causes the current command to abort.

### debug_print(msg)
Prints a line to stderr.

### time.now()
Returns the current time. The returned object has the following members:

| member                        | description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| t.as_timezone(tz)             | Converts and returns the time `t` in the given timezone. Example: <br/>`{{ time.now().as_timezone("Europe/Berlin") }}`                                                             |
| t.weekday()                   | Returns the time's weekday. 0 means Monday and 6 means Sunday.                                                                                                                     |
| t.hour()                      | Returns the time's hour from 0-23.                                                                                                                                                 |
| t.minute()                    | Returns the time's minute from 0-59.                                                                                                                                               |
| t.second()                    | Returns the time's second from 0-59.                                                                                                                                               |
| t.nanosecond()                | Returns the time's nanosecond from 0-999999999.                                                                                                                                    |
| t + delta                     | Adds a delta to `t`. Example: `{{ time.now() + time.second * 10 }}`                                                                                                                |
| t - delta                     | Subtracts a delta from `t`. Example: `{{ time.now() - time.second * 10 }}`                                                                                                         |
| t1 < t2<br/>t1 >= t2<br/> ... | Time objects can be compared to other time objects. Example:<br/>`{% if time.now() < time.parse_iso("2022-10-01T10:00") %}...{% endif %}`<br/>All logical operators are supported. |

### time.utcnow()
Returns the current time in UTC.
The object has the same members as described in [time.now()](#timenow).

### time.parse_iso(iso_time_str)
Parse the given string and return a time object. The string must be in ISO time. 
The object has the same members as described in [time.now()](#timenow).

### time.second, time.minute, time.hour
Represents a time delta to be used with `t + delta` and `t - delta`. Example
```
{{ time.now() + time.minute * 10 }}
```
