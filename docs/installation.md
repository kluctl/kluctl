# Installation

Kluctl is available as a CLI and as a GitOps controller.

## Installing the CLI

### Binaries

The kluctl CLI is available as a binary executable for all major platforms,
the binaries can be downloaded form GitHub
[releases page](https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl/releases).

### Installation with Homebrew

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for macOS and Linux:

```sh
brew install kluctl/tap/kluctl
```

### Installation with Bash

With [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -s https://kluctl.io/install.sh | bash
```

The install script does the following:
* attempts to detect your OS
* downloads and unpacks the release tar file in a temporary directory
* copies the kluctl binary to `/usr/local/bin`
* removes the temporary directory

### Build from source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl
cd kluctl
```

Build the `kluctl` binary (requires go >= 1.19):

```bash
make build
```

Run the binary:

```bash
./bin/kluctl -h
```


<!-- TODO uncomment when chocolatey support is implemented
### Chocolatey

With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows:

```powershell
choco install kluctl
```

-->

<!-- TODO uncomment this when completion is implemented
To configure your shell to load `kluctl` [bash completions](./cmd/kluctl_completion_bash.md) add to your profile:

```sh
. <(kluctl completion bash)
```

[`zsh`](./cmd/kluctl_completion_zsh.md), [`fish`](./cmd/kluctl_completion_fish.md),
and [`powershell`](./cmd/kluctl_completion_powershell.md)
are also supported with their own sub-commands.

-->

### Container images

A container image with `kluctl` is available on GitHub:

* `ghcr.io/kluctl/kluctl:<version>`

## Installing the GitOps Controller

The controller can be installed via two available options.

### Using the "install" sub-command

The [`kluctl controller install`](./reference/commands/controller-install.md) command can be used to install the
controller. It will use an embedded version of the Controller Kluctl deployment project
found [here](https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl/tree/main/install/controller).

### Using a Kluctl deployment

To manage and install the controller via Kluctl, you can use a Git include in your own deployment:

```yaml
deployments:
  - git:
      url: https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl.git
      subDir: install/controller
      ref: v2.20.4
```
