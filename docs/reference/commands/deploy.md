## Command
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "deploy" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl deploy [flags]

Deploys a target to the corresponding cluster
This command will also output a diff between the initial state and the state after
deployment. The format of this diff is the same as for the 'diff' command.
It will also output a list of prunable objects (without actually deleting them).

                                                    documentation for more details.
      --short-output                                When using the 'text' output format (which is the default),
                                                    only names of changes objects are shown instead of showing all
                                                    changes.
  -y, --yes                                         Suppresses 'Are you sure?' questions and proceeds as if you

### --force-apply
kluctl implements deployments via [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
and a custom automatic conflict resolution algorithm. This algurithm is an automatic implementation of the
"[Don't overwrite value, give up management claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#conflicts)"
method. It should work in most cases, but might still fail. In case of such failure, you can use `--force-apply` to
use the "Overwrite value, become sole manager" strategy instead.

Please note that this is a risky operation which might overwrite fields which were initially managed by kluctl but were
then overtaken by other managers (e.g. by operators). Always use this option with caution and perform a dry-run
before to ensure nothing unexpected gets overwritten.

### --replace-on-error
In some situations, patching Kubernetes objects might fail for different reasons. In such cases, you can try
`--replace-on-error` to instruct kluctl to retry with an update operation.

Please note that this will cause all fields to be overwritten, even if owned by other field managers.

### --force-replace-on-error
This flag will cause the same replacement attempt on failure as with `--replace-on-error`. In addition, it will fallback
to a delete+recreate operation in case the replace also fails.

Please note that this is a potentially risky operation, especially when an object carries some kind of important state.

### --abort-on-error
kluctl does not abort a command when an individual object fails can not be updated. It collects all errors and warnings
and outputs them instead. This option modifies the behaviour to immediately abort the command.
