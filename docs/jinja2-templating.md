# Jinja2 Templating

kluctl uses a Jinja2 Templating engine to pre-process/render every involved configuration file and resource before
actually interpreting it. Only files that are explicitly excluded via [templateExcludes](./deployments.md#templateexcludes)
are not rendered via Jinja2.

Generally, everything that is possible with Jinja2 is possible in kluctl configuration/resources. Please
read into the [Jinja2 documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/) to understand what exactly
is possible and how to use it.

## vars from deployment.yml

[vars](./deployments.md#vars) can be used to add more variables to the deployment project. These are then available
for every kustomize deployment of the current deployment project and also inside all included sub-deployments.

These are however not available while the `deployment.yml` is rendered that defines these vars. This file is
rendered and interpreted before the `vars` are processed and added to the Jinja2 context.

However, each entry in `vars` can use all variables defined before that specific file is processed. Consider the
following example.

```yaml
vars:
- file: vars1.yml
- file: vars2.yml
```

`vars2.yml` can now use variables that are defined in `vars1.yml`. At all times, variables defined by
parents of the current sub-deployment project can be used in the current vars file.

Different types of vars entries are possible:

### file
This loads variables from a yaml file. Assume the following yaml file with the name `vars1.yml`:
```yaml
my_vars:
  a: 1
  b: "b"
  c:
    - l1
    - l2
```

This file can be loaded via:

```yaml
vars:
  - file: vars1.yml
```

After which all included kustomizeDirs and sub-deployments can use the jinja2 variables from `vars1.yml`.

### values
An inline definition of variables. Example:

```yaml
vars:
  - values:
      a: 1
      b: c
```

These variables can then be used in all kustomizeDirs and sub-deployments.

### clusterConfigMap
Loads a configmap from the target's cluster and loads the specified key's value as a yaml file into the jinja2 variables
context.

Assume the following configmap to be deployed to the target cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-vars
  namespace: my-namespace
data:
  vars: |
    a: 1
    b: "b"
    c:
      - l1
      - l2
```

This configmap can be loaded via:

```yaml
vars:
  - clusterConfigMap:
      name: my-vars
      namespace: my-namespace
      key: vars
```

It assumes that the configmap is already deployed before the kluctl deployment happens. This might for example be
useful to store meta information about the cluster itself and then make it available to kluctl deployments.

### clusterSecret
Same as clusterConfigMap, but for secrets.

## Global variables
There are multiple variables available which are pre-defined by kluctl. These are:

### cluster
This is the cluster definition as found in the cluster yaml that belongs to the chosen target cluster. See
[cluster config](./cluster-config.md) for details on what this variable contains.

### args
This is a dictionary of arguments given via command line. It contains every argument defined in
[deployment args](./deployments.md#args).

### images
This global object provides the dynamic images features described in [images](./images.md).

### version
This global object defines latest version filters for `images.get_image(...)`. See [images](./images.md) for details.

### secrets
This global object is only available while [sealing](./sealed-secrets.md#jinja2-templating) and contains the loaded
secrets defined via the current sealing run.

## Global filters
In addition to the [builtin Jinja2 filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters),
kluctl provides a few additional filters:

### b64encode
Encodes the input value as base64. Example: `{{ "test" | b64encode }}` will result in `dGVzdA==`.

### b64decode
Decodes an input base64 encoded string. Example `{{ my.source.var | b64decode }}`.

### from_yaml
Parses a yaml string and returns an object. Please note that json is valid yaml, meaning that you can also use this
filter to parse json.

### to_yaml
Converts a variable/object into its yaml representation. Please note that in most cases the resulting string will not
be properly indented, which will require you to also use the `indent` filter. Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {{ my_config | to_yaml | indent(4) }}
```

### to_json
Same as `to_yaml`, but with json as output. Please note that json is always valid yaml, meaning that you can also use
`to_json` in yaml files. Consider the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: c1
        image: my-image
        env: {{ my_list_of_env_entries | to_json }}
```

This would render json into a yaml file, which is still a valid yaml file. Compare this to how this would have to be
solved with `to_yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: c1
        image: my-image
        env:
          {{ my_list_of_env_entries | to_yaml | indent(10) }}
```

The required indention filter is the part that makes this error-prone and hard to maintain. Consider using `to_json`
whenever you can.

### render
Renders the input string with the current Jinja2 context. Example:
```
{% set a="{{ my_var }}" %}
{{ a | render }}
```

## Global functions
In addition to the provided
[builtin global functions](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#list-of-global-functions),
kluctl also provides a few global functions:

### load_template(file)
Loads the given file into memory, renders it with the current Jinja2 context and then returns it as a string. Example:
```
{% set a=load_template('file.yml') %}
{{ a }}
```

The filename given to `load_template` is treated as relative to the template that is currently rendered.

### load_sha256(file, digest_len)
Loads the given file into memory, renders it and calculates the sha256 hash of the result.

The filename given to `load_sha256` is treated the same as in `load_template`. Recursive loading/calculating of hashes
is allowed and is solved by replacing `load_sha256` invocations with currently loaded templates with dummy strings.
This also allows to calculate the hash of the currently rendered template, for example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config-{{ load_sha256("configmap.yml") }}
data:
```

`digest_len` is an optional parameter that allows to limit the length of the returned hex digest.

### get_var(field_path, default)
Convenience method to navigate through the current context variables via a
[JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). Let's assume you currently have these variables defines 
(e.g. via [vars](./deployments.md#vars)):
```yaml
my:
  deep:
    var: value
```
Then `{{ get_var('my.deep.var', 'my-default') }}` would return `value`.
When any of the elements inside the field path are non-existent, the given default value is returned instead.

The `field_path` parameter can also be a list of pathes, which are then tried one after the another, returning the first
result that gives a value that is not None. For example, `{{ get_var(['non.existing.var', my.deep.var'], 'my-default') }}`
would also return `value`.

### merge_dict(d1, d2)
Clones d1 and then recursively merges d2 into it and returns the result. Values inside d2 will override values in d1.

### update_dict(d1, d2)
Same as `merge_dict`, but merging is performed in-place into d1.

### raise(msg)
Raises a python exception with the given message. This causes the current command to abort.

### debug_print(msg)
Prints a line to stderr.

## Includes and imports
Standard Jinja2 [includes](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#include) and
[imports](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#import) can be used in all templates.

The path given to include/import is treated as relative to the template that is currently rendered.

## Macros

[Jinja2 macros](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#macros) are fully supported. When writing
macros that produce yaml resources, you must use the `---` yaml separator in case you want to produce multiple resources
in one go.
