# Command line interface

kluctl offers a unified command line interface that allows to standardize all your deployments. Every project,
no matter how different it is from other projects, is managed the same way.

You can always call `kluctl --help` or `kluctl <command> --help` for a help prompt.

# Common command arguments
A few sets of arguments are common between multiple commands. These arguments are still part of the command itself and
must be placed *after* the command name.

The following sets of common arguments are available:

## project arguments
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "deploy" "Project arguments" true -->
```
  Project arguments:              Define where and how to load the kluctl project and its components from.
    -p, --project-url TEXT        Git url of the kluctl project. If not specified, the current directory will be used
                                  instead of a remote Git project
    -b, --project-ref TEXT        Git ref of the kluctl project. Only used when --project-url was given.
    -c, --project-config FILE     Location of the .kluctl.yml config file. Defaults to $PROJECT/.kluctl.yml
    --local-clusters DIRECTORY    Local clusters directory. Overrides the project from .kluctl.yml
    --local-deployment DIRECTORY  Local deployment directory. Overrides the project from .kluctl.yml
    --local-sealed-secrets DIRECTORY
                                  Local sealed-secrets directory. Overrides the project from .kluctl.yml
    --from-archive PATH           Load project (.kluctl.yml, cluster, ...) from archive. Given path can either be an
                                  archive file or a directory with the extracted contents.
    --from-archive-metadata PATH  Specify where to load metadata (targets, ...) from. If not specified, metadata is
                                  assumed to be part of the archive.
    --cluster TEXT                Specify/Override cluster
    -a, --arg TEXT                Template argument in the form name=value
    -t, --target TEXT             Target name to run command for. Target must exist in .kluctl.yml.
```
<!-- END SECTION -->

These arguments control where and how to load the kluctl project and deployment project.

## image arguments
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "deploy" "Image arguments" true -->
```
  Image arguments: 
    -F, --fixed-image TEXT        Pin an image to a given version. Expects '--fixed-
                                  image=image<:namespace:deployment:container>=result'
    --fixed-images-file FILE      Use .yml file to pin image versions. See output of list-images sub-command or read
                                  the documentation for details about the output format
    -u, --update-images           This causes kluctl to prefer the latest image found in registries, based on the
                                  `latest_image` filters provided to 'images.get_image(...)' calls. Use this flag if
                                  you want to update to the latest versions/tags of all images. '-u' takes precedence
                                  over `--fixed-image/--fixed-images-file`, meaning that the latest images are used
                                  even if an older image is given via fixed images.
```
<!-- END SECTION -->

These arguments control image versions requested by `images.get_image(...)` [calls](./images.md#imagesget_image).

## Inclusion/Exclusion arguments
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "deploy" "Inclusion/Exclusion arguments" true -->
```
  Inclusion/Exclusion arguments: 
                                  Control inclusion/exclusion.
    -I, --include-tag TEXT        Include deployments with given tag.
    -E, --exclude-tag TEXT        Exclude deployments with given tag. Exclusion has precedence over inclusion, meaning
                                  that explicitly excluded deployments will always be excluded even if an inclusion
                                  rule would match the same deployment.
    --include-kustomize-dir TEXT  Include kustomize dir. The path must be relative to the root deployment project.
    --exclude-kustomize-dir TEXT  Exclude kustomize dir. The path must be relative to the root deployment project.
                                  Exclusion has precedence over inclusion, same as in --exclude-tag
```
<!-- END SECTION -->

These arguments control inclusion/exclusion based on tags and kustomize depoyment pathes.

# Environment variables
All options/arguments accepted by kluctl can also be specified via environment variables. The name of the environment
variables always start with `KLUCTL_` and end witht the option/argument in uppercase and dashes replaced with
underscores. As an example, `--project=my-project` can also be specified with the environment variable
`KLUCTL_PROJECT=my-project`.

## Additional environment variables
A few additional environment variables are supported which do not belong to an option/argument. These are:

1. `KLUCTL_REGISTRY_<idx>_HOST`, `KLUCTL_REGISTRY_<idx>_USERNAME`, and so on. See [registries](./images.md#supported-image-registries-and-authentication) for details.
2. `KLUCTL_GIT_TIMEOUT`. Specifies how long to wait on git subprocesses to finish until they are killed.
3. `KLUCTL_NO_THREADS`. Do not use multithreading while performing work. This is only useful for debugging purposes.
4. `KLUCTL_IGNORE_DEBUGGER`. Pretend that there is no debugger attached when automatically deciding if multi-threading should be enabled or not.
5. `TMPDIR, TEMP or TMP`. Because kluctl uses [tempfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html), you can set the output directory for temporary files (e.g. git-cache, repositories, rendered files) with the aforementioned envs. 

# Commands
The following commands are available:

## bootstrap
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "bootstrap" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl bootstrap [OPTIONS]

  Bootstrap a target cluster.

  This will install the sealed-secrets operator into the specified cluster if not already installed.

  Either --target or --cluster must be specified.

<!-- END SECTION -->

The following sets of arguments are available:
1. [project arguments](#project-arguments)

In addition, the following arguments are available:
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "bootstrap" "Misc arguments" true -->
```
  Misc arguments: 
    -y, --yes                     Suppresses 'Are you sure?' questions and proceeds as if you would answer 'yes'.
    --dry-run                     Performs all kubernetes API calls in dry-run mode.
    --force-apply                 Force conflict resolution when applying. See documentation for details
    --replace-on-error            When patching an object fails, try to replace it. See documentation for more
                                  details.
    --force-replace-on-error      Same as --replace-on-error, but also try to delete and re-create objects. See
                                  documentation for more details.
    --hook-timeout DURATION       Maximum time to wait for hook readiness. The timeout is meant per-hook. Timeouts are
                                  in the duration format (1s, 1m, 1h, ...). If not specified, a default timeout of 5m
                                  is used.
    --abort-on-error              Abort deploying when an error occurs instead of trying the remaining deployments
    -o, --output TEXT             Specify output format and target file, in the format 'format=path'. Format can
                                  either be 'text' or 'yaml'. Can be specified multiple times. The actual format for
                                  yaml is currently not documented and subject to change.
```
<!-- END SECTION -->

## deploy
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "deploy" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl deploy [OPTIONS]

  Deploys a target to the corresponding cluster.

  This command will also output a diff between the initial state and the state after deployment. The format of this
  diff is the same as for the `diff` command. It will also output a list of prunable objects (without actually
  deleting them).

```
<!-- END SECTION -->

### --parallel
kluctl runs deployments sequentially and in-order by default. This options allows kluctl to perform all deployments
in parallel, which speeds up the deployment significantly.

Due to the nature of parallel deployments, no guarantees can't be made in regard to deployment order. This means for
example, that objects that are meant to be deployed into a namespace might be deployed before the namespace is deployed,
resulting in failure.

### --force-apply
kluctl implements deployments via [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
and a custom automatic conflict resolution algorithm. This algurithm is an automatic implementation of the
"[Don't overwrite value, give up management claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#conflicts)"
method. It should work in most cases, but might still fail. In case of such failure, you can use `--force-apply` to
use the "Overwrite value, become sole manager" strategy instead.

Please note that this is a risky operation which might overwrite fields which were initially managed by kluctl but were
then overtaken by other managers (e.g. by operators). Always use this option with caution and perform a dry-run
before to ensure nothing unexpected gets overwritten.

### --replace-on-error
In some situations, updating Kubernetes objects is not possible, for example when modified fields are read-only. Jobs
are a good example where this might be the case. In such cases, you can use `--replace-on-error` to instruct kluctl to
retry an update by deleting and then recreating the object.

Please note that this is a potentially risky operation, especially when an object carries some kind of important state.

### --abort-on-error
kluctl does not abort a command when an individual object fails can not be updated. It collects all errors and warnings
and outputs them instead. This option modifies the behaviour to immediately abort the command.

## diff
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "diff" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl diff [OPTIONS]

  Perform a diff between the locally rendered target and the already deployed target.

  The output is by default in human readable form (a table combined with unified diffs). The output can also be
  changed to output yaml file. Please note however that the format is currently not documented and prone to changes.

  After the diff is performed, the command will also search for prunable objects and list them.
